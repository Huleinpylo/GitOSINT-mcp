# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in **GitOSINT-mcp**, please don’t file a public GitHub issue. Instead:

Open a **private** GitHub issue by selecting the “Security” category. (See “Reporting via GitHub” below.)

### What to Include in Your Report

Please provide as much of the following as you can:

- Affected version or Git commit (e.g., “commit abc1234, branch feat-mcp”).  
- Steps to reproduce (exact commands, inputs, URLs).  
- Expected result vs. actual (e.g., “command `gitosint …` should not leak API tokens”).  
- Proof-of-Concept (PoC) or minimal reproduction code snippet.  
- Any logs, stack traces, or screenshots.

## Our Commitment

- **Acknowledgment:** We will respond within 5 business days to confirm receipt.  
- **Timeline:** We aim to release a patch or mitigation within 30 days of confirmation.  
- **Coordination:** We will coordinate a public advisory (CVE) if appropriate, and credit you unless you request anonymity.

## Reporting via GitHub

If you prefer GitHub’s built-in mechanism, please use the “**Security Issue**” template:

1. Go to **Issues → New issue**.  
2. Select the “Security Report” category (it will not be visible to the public).  
3. Fill in the same details as above.
